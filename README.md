## What is BruinYelp?

BruinYelp is UCLA's premier resource for eating on campus. Made for bruins by bruins, Bruinyelp allows users to rate and review dining locations on all parts of campus, from the top of the hill to the below-ground bomb shelter. Don't know what you want to eat? We've got you covered with our top of the line filtering system, allowing you to eat, enjoy, and then get right back to work (it is UCLA after all)!

## How to run BruinYelp on your machine

### Download Code to Local Environment

Clone the repository, `cd` into it if necessary, and install the requirements (assuming you already have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/CamiChou/BruinFoodReview
cd ./BruinFoodReview
npm install
```

### Run the app

In the root directory, simply run:
```bash
npm start
```
which starts the client-side app as well as listen on the server, meaning the app should open in your browser. Note that it may take some time for npm to start the server. If it does not, enter http://localhost:3000/ into your browser and you should be good to go. Once the app has opened, you will need to create a BruinYelp account in order to post reviews. This can be done relatively easily using your google account information.
