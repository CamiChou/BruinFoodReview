## How to run BruinYelp on your machine

### Get Local code

Clone the repository, `cd` into it if necessary, and install the requirements (assuming you already have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your machine):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/CamiChou/BruinFoodReview
cd ./BruinFoodReview
npm install
```

### Run the app

In the root directory, simply run:
```bash
npm start
```
which starts the client-side app as well as listen on the server, meaning the app should open in your browser. Note that it may take some time for npm to start the server. If it does not, enter http://localhost:3000/ into your browser and you should be good to go. Once the app has opened, you will need to create a BruinYelp account in order to post reviews. This can be done relatively easily using your google account information.
